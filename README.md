# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Playing Atari games ðŸŽ®

## What's Deep Reinforcement Learning?

Deep Reinforcement learning is a combination of reinforcement learning and deep learning. 

Implementation of DQN algorithm on CartPole and Breakout from gym environment

Our games have a discrete action spaces, Cartpole can only move right or left and Breakout has two more actions available: do nothing and fire.

###Details on a Markov Decision Process

###And what about DQN?
